## Developing & testing

We recommend developing using Docker, although virtual env is also very good (these tools are useful to make sure that you're using a stable, reproducible, environment). The Python script `./scripts/run` is our main development tool which automates build & checking tasks.

**Tests** and general checks are currently are run with:

    ./scripts/run build
    ./scripts/run check

For quicker tests, while developing, try `./scripts/run test`.

**Documentation** may be built in the `/site` folder using:

    ./scripts/run doc

## Publishing

 1. (optionally) update requirements `./scripts/run -i base build --no-cache && ./scripts/run -i base refreeze`
 2. run the pre-publish checks `./scripts/run check`
 3. check that you're happy with `version.txt`
 4. `python3 setup.py sdist upload -r pypi` (you must first set up pypi & GPG credentials)
 5. `git push origin HEAD:refs/tags/$(cat version.txt)`
 6. update, commit & push `version.txt`
